## Description

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. This program takes two strings as input and determines whether they are anagrams of each other.

## How to Use

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Compile the source code using a C compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Follow the prompts to enter two strings.
4. The program will then determine whether the entered strings are anagrams of each other and display the result.

## Example

Enter two strings and I'll tell you if they're anagrams.
Enter the first string: listen
Enter the second string: silent
listen and silent are anagrams
